Hello viewers ! 
In this project i have analyzed two data sets and gained some meaningful insights that can help the stakeholders make informed decisions to uplift the business.
The data set named 'playstore data' contains over 10000 rows and the dataset named 'user review' contains over 60000 rows . 
I have tried to solve these questions - 
   1 . what are the top categories ?
   2 . which category has the most number of installations ?
   3 . are majority of apps paid or free ?
   4 . how does the installation vary with the app size ?
   5 . how does the installation vary with price ?
   6 . how does rating vary with the size of the app ?
   7 . how does the android version affects the installation ?
   8 . what is the age group that is compatible for the most of the apps ?
   9 . how is the ratings distribution ?
   10 . To which extent sentimant subjectivity and sentiment polarity are co-related ?
   11 . how sentimant subjectivity and sentiment polarity are distributed ?
   12 . what is the count of sentiments for each type ?
   13 . what is the type of major sentiments given by the users ?
